The attached file is an exam paper. Read it carefully and extract the data from it, and respond purely with a JSON object to represent the Exam object described in the following schema:

Exam {
    title: string; // title of the exam paper ("No title" as default).
    description: string; // description of the exam paper ("No description" as default).
    maxDuration: number; // maximum allowed duration of the exam in minutes (0 if not stated)
    maxMarks: number; // maximum number of marks that can be awarded
    questions: ExamQuestion[]; // array of all questions that the exam paper asks
}

ExamQuestion {
    kind: 'text' | 'radio' | 'checkbox'; // best format to present the question with on an HTML page
    text: string; // question being asked
    maxMarks: number; // maximum number of marks that can be awarded for this question (0 if not stated)
    answerRows?: number; // number of rows for the answer text box (applicable only for text questions)
    options?: string[]; // array of potential responses (applicable only for radio and checkbox)
}

All information must be accurately drawn from the document, no guesses or large assumptions should be made, your response should be pure JSON and nothing else.
